        <p>Users have the option of making certain personal information available to other Community PlanIt users, such as age, gender, personal interests, institutional affiliations, and a picture. At a minimum, to participate in Community PlanIt, users must provide their email address, name, and connection to the community.</p>
        <p>To help understand the impact of these services on people's neighborhood planning processes, Community PlanIt keeps track of the pages users visit within the Community PlanIt website and how frequently users use system services. Community PlanIt maintains an archive of content transmitted through the system. Any communication or information you share over these services will not be considered confidential. Community PlanIt is part of an ongoing research project by Emerson College at the Engagement Game Lab, and information posted, transmitted and otherwise collected by Community PlanIt may be used in research reports, journals, books, and other publications without additional permission or compensation.
