Hello {{firstName}},

Thanks for registering for Lowell Community PlanIt! We're glad you've decided to join us in helping to shape a vision for sustainability in Lowell.

From Wednesday, June 15 through Friday, June 25, we are using http://communityplanit.org as a way to engage residents in long-range, citywide planning
as we think toward the future. Remember that you can participate as often as you like, from any place that has access to the internet. We hope you will 
share your thoughts about Lowell by completing all the activities and spending your in-game coins on the issues that matter to you most.

We look forward to planning with you!
