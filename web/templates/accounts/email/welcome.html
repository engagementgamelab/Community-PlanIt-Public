Hello!

Thanks for registering for Lowell Community PlanIt! We're glad you've decided to join us in helping to shape a vision for sustainability in Lowell.

From Wednesday, June 15 through Friday, June 25, we are using http://communityplanit.org as a way to engage residents in long-range, citywide planning as we think toward the future. The feedback we receive will be considered when making future policy decisions in Lowell. Remember that you can sign on to participate as often as you like, from any place that has access to the internet. We hope you will share your thoughts about Lowell by completing all the activities, interacting with other users, and spending your in-game coins on the issues that matter to you most. 

Please take a few moments to fill out a short survey at http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/cpi-lowell. Two lucky players will win $25 gift cards for their participation.

Happy planning!

Community PlanIt Team
